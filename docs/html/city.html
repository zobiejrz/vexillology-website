				<br>
				Designed by Ethan Lynsky. The horizontal red and steel stripes represent American Fork’s deep history in the steel
				industry. The triangle in the center represents the wasatch mountain range and, specifically, Mount Timpanogos. The
				colors of the triangle being red, white, and blue are there to represent the patriotism exhibited all throughout
				American Fork city.

			<div class="row" id="meta-data">
				<img src="../img/City Flags/Cedar Hills.jpg">
				<br>
				Designed by Sam Gustaveson, Anna Lisa Lyons, and Rosey Stewart. The mountains on this flag represent the hills and
				mountains that make up Cedar Hills. The white line represents the trails that are in Cedar Hills. The green of the
				mountains represent the wildlife found all over Cedar Hills.

			<div class="row" id="meta-data">
				<img src="../img/ComingSoon.png">
				<br>
				Designed by Mitch Gregory. Our design for Lehi City's flag incorporates what we believe to be large characteristics
				in what makes Lehi a great city. The green represents what is currently Lehi city's flag, and how Lehi has vast
				acres of grassy fields, the blue is also in Lehi's flag - and it represents the blue skies over Lehi. The mountain
				in the flag represents a couple things, the white top represents Silicon Slopes, which many companies have chosen
				to build their headquarters in Lehi which boosts the economy. The rising mountain shows growth and prosperity as we
				continue to climb economically. The star in the middle represents how Lehi is the center of population in Utah.

				<img src="../img/City Flags/Orem 1.jpg">
				<br>
				Designed by Mia Bradshaw. For the redesign of the Orem flag I took the elements from the current Orem City flag and
				simplified them. The white ring around the sun is an O for Orem. The mountain is for Timpanogos mountain, and the
				blue is for Utah lake.

			<div class="row" id="meta-data">
				<img src="../img/City Flags/Orem 2.jpg">
				<br>
				Designed by Parker Smith. The only problem that I had with the current city flag was the letting which spelled out
				the word “OREM” on the bottom. One of the five principles used to make all good flags specifically states that no
				lettering or seals be used on the flag. So, when I altered the current city flag, I simply removed the letting
				which spelled “OREM” on the bottom. Everything else about the flag stayed the same.

				<br>
				This is the Orem Flag redesign made by Spencer and Cole Terry, Kelton Wagley, Isaac Spencer, and Thomas Vick. It is
				based on the original Orem flag design, but is more geometric in style and simpler, omitting the text that was
				previously present

			<img src="../img/City Flags/Pleasant Grove 1.jpg">
			<br>
			Designed by Sam Gadd. This is the flag of Pleasant Grove. The blue field represents how high we are in altitude and
			close to the mountains. Though, it should have gray splotches on it because our air is trash. The main “gear” in the
			middle represents what most of PG used to work for: Geneva Steel. The mountains represent how close we are and on
			the mountains, and of course the lake is Utah lake.
		</div>

		<div class="row" id="meta-data">
			<img src="../img/City Flags/Pleasant Grove 2.jpg">
			<br>
			Designed by Zane Elkins. My flag was for Pleasant Grove, so I had a mountain in the bottom because Pleasant Grove is
			right next to the mountains. The mountain also represents the trees and animals that are there, the city is also
			called “The City of Trees” I put a sun in the left of the sky for the sunlight and happiness that is here hence
			“Pleasant Grove”.
		</div>


		<div class="row" id="meta-data">
			<img src="../img/City Flags/Provo.jpg">
			<br>
			Designed by Ciara Johnson. The Provo Flag has a blue bottom that symbolizes the Provo River. At the tip of the of
			the green mountain there is a white Outline of a diamond which represents the snow in Provo canyon. Finally the sun
			behind the mountains makes for a beautiful sunrise.

			<img src="../img/City Flags/Salt Lake City.jpg">
			<br>
			Designed by Kason Haug. This flag is the redesign of Salt Lake City. It uses three horizontal stripe with the top
			and bottom being green kinda like the current Salt Lake flag. Then the middle stripe is white and in the middle of
			that white stripe is the state capitol building because Salt Lake is the capital of Utah.

		</div>

		<div class="row" id="meta-data">
			<img src="../img/City Flags/Vineyard.jpg">
			<br>
			Designed by Christiaan Howland. For the vineyard flag I decided to have the flag represent the Holdaways with the
			red of their crest. The rectangles represent Vineyard’s beautiful skies, the rapid growth, and the lake, going from
			top to bottom. The diamonds represent our history of industry and our hope for more, the fact that there are three
			represents that we have had three mayors in total.
