				Designed by Ethan Lynsky.<blockquote></blockquote> For the City of American Fork.<blockquote></blockquote> "The
				horizontal red and steel stripes represent American Fork’s deep history in the steel
				industry. The triangle in the center represents the wasatch mountain range and, specifically, Mount Timpanogos. The
				colors of the triangle being red, white, and blue are there to represent the patriotism exhibited all throughout

				Hills.<blockquote></blockquote> "The mountains on this flag represent the hills and
				mountains that make up Cedar Hills. The white line represents the trails that are in Cedar Hills. The green of the

				<br>
				Designed by Mitch Gregory.<blockquote></blockquote> For the City of Lehi.<blockquote></blockquote> "Our design for
				Lehi City's flag incorporates what we believe to be large characteristics
				in what makes Lehi a great city. The green represents what is currently Lehi city's flag, and how Lehi has vast
				acres of grassy fields, the blue is also in Lehi's flag - and it represents the blue skies over Lehi. The mountain
				in the flag represents a couple things, the white top represents Silicon Slopes, which many companies have chosen
				to build their headquarters in Lehi which boosts the economy. The rising mountain shows growth and prosperity as we
				continue to climb economically. The star in the middle represents how Lehi is the center of population in Utah."

				Designed by Mia Bradshaw.<blockquote></blockquote> For the City of Orem.<blockquote></blockquote> "For the redesign
				of the Orem flag I took the elements from the current Orem City flag and
				simplified them. The white ring around the sun is an O for Orem. The mountain is for Timpanogos mountain, and the
				blue is for Utah lake."

				<br>
				Designed by Parker Smith.<blockquote></blockquote> For the City of Orem.<blockquote></blockquote>"The only problem
				that I had with the current city flag was the letting which spelled out
				the word “OREM” on the bottom. One of the five principles used to make all good flags specifically states that no
				lettering or seals be used on the flag. So, when I altered the current city flag, I simply removed the letting
				which spelled “OREM” on the bottom. Everything else about the flag stayed the same."

			Designed by Sam Gadd.<blockquote></blockquote>For the City of Pleasant Grove.<blockquote></blockquote> "This is the
			flag of Pleasant Grove. The blue field represents how high we are in altitude and
			close to the mountains. Though, it should have gray splotches on it because our air is trash. The main “gear” in the
			middle represents what most of PG used to work for: Geneva Steel. The mountains represent how close we are and on
			the mountains, and of course the lake is Utah lake."

			<br>
			Designed by Zane Elkins.<block></block>For the City of Pleasant Grove.<blockquote></blockquote> "My flag was for
			Pleasant Grove, so I had a mountain in the bottom because Pleasant Grove is
			right next to the mountains. The mountain also represents the trees and animals that are there, the city is also
			called “The City of Trees” I put a sun in the left of the sky for the sunlight and happiness that is here hence
			“Pleasant Grove”."

			top to bottom. The diamonds represent our history of industry and our hope for more, the fact that there are three
			represents that we have had three mayors in total."
